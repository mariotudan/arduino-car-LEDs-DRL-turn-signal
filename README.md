# Arduino controlled custom LED strips for DRL and turn signals
Arduino project for controlling digital WWA LED strips to act as car DRL and sequential turn signals.

This project uses digital WWA LED strips (144 LEDs/m) which are going to be deployed to car headlight as additional lights. (Previous version was using Adafruit Neopixel RGB LED strips (60 LEDs/m) and all that changed in code are color structs and speed of refreshing)
